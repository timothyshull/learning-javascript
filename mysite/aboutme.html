<p>The best and worst decision I ever made in my life was to fall in love with music. I guess, if I am being honest, I should probably say that it was less of a decision and more of an undeniable magnetic pull. Whatever it is, it has taken me down a somewhat curvy path as an adult.</p>

<p>As an adult I have done a lot…government work in DC tracking bird flu, carpentry and the mountain life in Asheville, NC, framing masterpieces of modern art, performing country music, like real, old-style country music, in Nashville, handling financials for dentists and landscaping impresarios, a short, wintery sojourn in Pittsburgh, sunny studies in Spain playing with computers to make weird sounds, and now Oakland.</p>

<p>While music has been front and center, the math-centric side of my brain has always been bubbling in the background. Math, as a discipline, has as much in common with art and music as it does with business and engineering. I am constantly learning new things and all this tech business in the Bay Area has led me to a new passion in the place where computers, the web, music, math, and the mind meet.</p>

<p>My previous experience as a programmer involved basic OOP through C++, the history of computing and the web with <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/">this guy</a>, and some relatively basic GIS stuff. I came back to programming recently through Max/MSP while earning a master’s in music technology. It re-ignited an excitement for the core of a computer and how it can be used to make all sorts of cool things, but especially some crazy sounds.</p>

<p>Since then I have been devouring everything in sight related to programming and web development. I have been learning (or relearning) C, C++, Objective-C, Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here are a few other things I am currently excited about; Node, Cocoa, JavaScript SPAs and related frameworks, Bootstrap, Kendo, Foundation, Snap, PaaS, and the list goes on.</p>
