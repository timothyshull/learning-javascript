            <p>Timothy Shull, Jr.
Music Technologist - Production, Design, and Programming

Summary
I am a musician and technologist. My passion is producing new sounds and tools for music creation by combining experimentation with informed, practical knowledge. My expertise includes music production, computer programming for sound design and synthesis applications, and computer-based sound installations and performance. I am also highly capable and experienced working with data; I have a degree in mathematics and previously worked for 4+ years as a paraprofessional accountant and systems support technician. Prior to moving to the Bay Area, I lived in Valencia, Spain where I earned a master’s degree in music technology and production from Berklee College of Music. I graduated summa cum laude thanks to my work ethic and dedication to the subject. My classmates selected me as the recipient of the MTI Peer Recognition Award because of my willingness to support and assist them with their work. I love to help others find their creative outlet by sharing my knowledge and experience. As an undergraduate at the University of Virginia I studied both music and mathematics. I prospered as part of the McIntire Department of Music, receiving the Brander Wyatt Morrison Prize and an award for Excellence in Music Research and Ethnography upon graduation. I also began studying computer science, knowledge that I continue to build on today. I approach each step of my career optimistically, maintaining a common thread of avid learning. I am currently working diligently
to improve at C, C++, and Ruby on Rails to build audio plug-ins and web applications. My goal for my next career step is to find a position in which I can combine all of my various talents and utilize them as an audio programmer, audio engineer, product designer, or product manager. If you feel that I can contribute to your organization, please contact me through my LinkedIn profile or at timothyshull@gmail.com.

1 person has recommended Timothy
"Smart and personable, reliable and enthusiastic. Tim is self-motivated, actively interested in studying
a problem to seek a solution. He possesses the intellect to not only discover an answer but to effectively articulate his recommendations. He always accepted non-routine assignments willingly and approached every task with unusual energy. We were fortunate to have Tim as an employee, but always knew his destiny lied beyond our door."
— John Horrocks, managed Timothy
Contact Timothy on LinkedIn


I write to you as a Music Technology Innovation instructor at Berklee Valencia, to recommend Timothy Shull as a candidate for employment at your institution.  In the time I've known Tim last school term, he was an extraordinary leader in our department, and one of the most technically literate and creatively charged students on our campus.


As a technologist, Tim has an intuitive sense of picking up new programs.  He is the type of inquisitive mind that is not simply satisfied with know how something works, but insists on figuring out why it works, and how to make it work better.  He was a leading innovator in our program, with ideas that expanded beyond the classroom content and down to the coding level of many programs we were using only on the surface.


As an artist, I recall an occasion where I was positively moved to speechlessness by a deeply soulful electronic-acoustic tune that a friend randomly had me listen to.  It was not until the end of the song when I was informed that the piece of music was actually a composition of Tim's.  Tim's creative intelligence is vast as it is rare, his musical gifts are an inspiration to students and teachers alike.  Even more rare are those who have an intellectual capacity to break down and describe the mechanics of his process such as Tim does.  Even sitting with him for five minutes will clue you in to the ocean of creative potential beneath the surface of this artist.


On top of his talents, Tim is easy to relate to and an all around great guy.  In the school term was elected by his peers to be a representative for his program, because everyone gets along with Tim, and he actually listens when you speak to him.


I know that Tim Shull will be a tremendous asset to your institution, and he comes with my highest recommendation of any student I taught in this term.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
