/*  
*   This is the base styling layer of our application.
*   Here should be written general styling for HTML elements and very straightforward classes
*   
*   You should:
*       - name your classes according to the context (e.g. submit-button)
*       - add variable with certain attribute value to variables.less and then call it here
*   You shouldn't:
*       - add complex classes with nested selectors, consider 'modules.less' instead
*       - directly specify any property value, without checking variables.less first (it might already be there).
