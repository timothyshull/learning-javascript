/*
    This is the second styling layer of our application
    Here should be written complete self-standing modules, that are injected on certain pages
    You should:
        - add only complete seld-standing modules, that make sense on their own
        - name your modules according to their functionality (e.g. login-form, comment-block)
        - use nesting (every module should have only one top level parent - wrapper)
        - add variable with certain attribute value to variables.less and then call it here
    You shouldn't:
        - add custom styling, that should be applied only on certain pages (consider 'pages.less' instead)
        - directly specify any property value, without checking variables.less first (it might already be there)
